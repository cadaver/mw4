  Metal Warrior 4:Agents of Metal V1.2

   A Covert Bitops production in 2012


              INSTRUCTIONS

    Use joystick or arrows to scroll,
    press FIRE/SPACE/RETURN to exit.


1. HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

Required:
- C64 or C128 (in C64 mode)
- Disk drive or hard disk

Optional:
- Joystick (highly recommended)
- SuperCPU (eliminates any slowdown)

Inbuilt fastloader supports the 1541,
1571, 1581, CMD FD, CMD HD and IDE64
drives. By switching the fastloader off,
any drive can be used.


2. LOADING

To load MW4:Agents of Metal, make sure
disk side 1 is in drive and type:
LOAD"MW4",8
RUN

(Replace 8 with your device number as
necessary.)

You will be presented with the startup
menu, where you can toggle the fast-
loader and loading picture options. Use
cursor keys + RETURN, or joystick in
port 2 to move and toggle options.

Select 'LOAD THE GAME' to go on. When
the game main part has been loaded you
will be asked to insert disk side 2.


2.1 HARD DISK INSTALLATION

MW4:Agents of Metal is not copyprotected
- to install on a hard disk, copy the
files from both sides of the MW4 disk to
a hard disk directory. The file '01' on
both sides is the fastloader and needs
to be copied only once.


2.2 TIPS FOR EMULATOR USERS

For fastest loading, switch off 'true
drive emulation' but let the fastloader
stay on. This behaves similarly as IDE64
loading: there are no graphics/sound
interruptions and the loading speed is
optimal.


3. PROLOGUE

Three weeks after the events depicted in
'Metal Warrior 3', two figures stand at
the gates of a deserted farm..

Led by a phone call consisting of
ominous pig grunts & squeals, and the
voice of the maniacal bassist/vocalist
LORD OBSKURIUS, they have been asked to
arrive at this place for reasons
unknown.

They are IAN SMITH (artist name yet
undecided) and JOAN ALDER (aka PHANTASM)
who were, on several occasions in the
past, drawn into violent conflict with
a powerful military conspiracy.

With the conspiracy revealed and brought
into justice, they should now be free to
live together in peace, wielding their
axes only in symbolic combat against the
evils of the future world.

But things are about to get weird.. The
Agents of Metal are about to enter the
picture.


4. INITIATION

You as the player are asked to assume
the control of IAN on his journey to the
unknown. As the story begins he is his
usual self but an Initiation and
Transformation into Agent form awaits..


5. CONTROLS

The game is controlled by joystick in
port 2, or by the keys

joystick left/right.

To jump away from a ladder, push the
joystick up diagonally.

To perform a 'wall-flip' while jumping,
push joystick up and to the direction
opposite to the wall at the moment you
hit the wall.


5.4 ITEM MANIPULATION

To pick up an item, crouch at it
(joystick DOWN; you are near enough when
the item's name is displayed). If you
cannot pick up an item, you likely have
reached your carrying capacity. See the
STATUS SCREEN if this is the case.

To drop an unnecessary item, select it
from the inventory and hold FIRE+UP for
1 second. If the screen is already full
of items (4 is the limit), you must go
somewhere else. When a firearm is
dropped, any ammunition held in it is
moved to the ammunition reserve.

To 'use' the currently selected item,
press FIRE+DOWN. Examples of items that
can be used are first aid kits,
armor rechargers, and the 'Agent gear'
you receive soon after game start!
Firearms are reloaded this way, also.


6. INGAME STATUS DISPLAY

The bottom left part of the screen shows
your score, current weapon/item selected
and ammunition remaining.

For firearms, the ammunition display is
split in two. Left side shows rounds in
magazine and right side shows number of
magazines remaining.

For melee weapons, INF (infinite) is
displayed.

The bottom right part shows your health
(H) and armor power (A) meters.

Keep an eye on the health meter; when it
falls to zero you are defeated and the
game is over.

The armor power bar will be displayed
only after receiving your Agent gear.
The armor will take most of the damage
as long as it has some power left.

To replenish health, use first aid kits.
To replenish armor power, use armor
rechargers.


7. MENU SYSTEM

Hold down the FIRE button for 1/2
seconds or press SPACE to pause and
access the main menu.

The main menu is divided into 3 sub-
screens: GAME MENU, INVENTORY, STATUS.
To move between them, push joystick
left/right. To move within a subscreen,
push joystick up/down. To activate a
menu item, press the fire button.

To leave the menu, press SPACE.


7.1 GAME MENU

Before a game is started, only the GAME
MENU is accessible.

NEW GAME
- Start a new game. You are presented
  with a difficulty level selection:

  EASY   - Reduced damage to player,
           carrying capacity 25kg

  NORMAL - Normal damage to player,
           carrying capacity 20kg

  HARD   - Extra damage to player,
           more enemies, carrying
           capacity 15kg

LOAD GAME
- Load an existing game.

SAVE GAME
- Save the current game. Select a slot
  between 1-3. Remember to save often to
  be able to continue in the case you're
  defeated!

QUIT GAME
- End game and return to title screen,
  or if not in game, end session and
  return to the BASIC prompt. You are
  asked to confirm.

MUSIC Y/N
- Toggles whether music will be played.
  With music off you will hear more
  sound effects, such as footsteps.

SOUND Y/N
- Toggles whether sound effects will be
  played.


7.2 INVENTORY

Here you can select the current item
(weapons, first aid kits etc.) in use.
Press FIRE or SPACE to confirm & return
to game.


7.3 STATUS SCREEN

The STATUS SCREEN displays your total
game time, weight of items carried, and
three status bars:

VIT   - Vitality
STR   - Strength
ARMOR - Armorsystem class

With higher vitality, the health bar
will deplete slower from damage.

Higher strength increases your carrying
capacity, so that more weapons and
supplies can be carried at a time. Your
melee attacks and thrown weapons
also become more powerful.

A higher armorsystem class means that
the armor can stop more damage before
requiring to be recharged.

Vitality & strength upgrades can be
found in enemy installations. Use
Surgical Units to install these. Armor
upgrades can also be found; these can be
installed simply by selecting from the
inventory and using (FIRE+DOWN).


8. INTERACTION

There are several ways to interact with
the game world. All of them are
activated by pressing FIRE+UP.


8.1 CONVERSATION

You need to stand near and face the
person you wish to talk to, and hold
FIRE+UP for about 1/4 seconds.

If no conversation begins, this means
simply that there's nothing important to
say at the moment - you might want to
come back later. Also, if the person is
engaged in combat, you must wait.

At times you are able to choose your
reply from multiple choices; this is
indicated by arrows in the message
window and a question mark above your
character's head. Press joystick UP/DOWN
to see choices and FIRE button to
select.

Sometimes conversations are also
triggered automatically when you are
near a person.


8.2 GAME WORLD OBJECTS

When you're standing at an object that
can be interacted with, an arrow will
flash at your character's feet.


8.2.1 DOORS, SWITCHES, CLOSETS

To enter a door, stand in front of it
and hold FIRE+UP for about 1/4 seconds.
Some doors need to be opened or unlocked
first by using a nearby switch or
keycard lock.

To operate a switch or lock, stand in
front of it and press FIRE+UP. Any item
required will be inserted automatically.

Closets might contain ammunition,
weapons or other useful items. press
FIRE+UP to open and reveal any items.


8.2.2 COMPUTER TERMINALS

Press FIRE+UP to read the contents of
the screen. They are displayed either
in the main game screen or in the
message window. Sometimes you might also
be presented with a control interface
similar to the game menu.


8.2.3 RECHARGERS AND SURGICAL UNITS

These fixed units can be used to regain
lost armor power or health. Press FIRE+
UP to operate. The surgical unit
presents you with an interface:

HEAL - Restore all health
VIT  - Install vitality upgrade
STR  - Install strength upgrade
EXIT - Return to game


8.2.4 ELEVATORS

To go up on an elevator, press FIRE+UP
while standing on its left half. To go
down, press FIRE+UP while standing on
the right half. An elevator call button
can usually be found next to an elevator
shaft.


9. THE MAP SCREEN

When you exit an area you are presented
with a map screen to choose your next
destination. Use the joystick to move
and FIRE to select.

New locations are added to the map as
you learn of their existence. Note that
you need to locate and use the ground
level exit of each enemy installation
before you can return to it simply via
the map screen.


10. WEAPONS & AMMUNITION

There are 21 different kinds of weapons
in the game, and of course your trusty
fists to fall back upon.

Note that by picking up every weapon you
encounter you will likely reach your
carrying capacity quickly.

Common ammunition types and uses:

9mm       - Pistols, Submachine gun
.44       - .44 Magnum pistol
5.56      - Automatic rifles
7.62      - Sniper rifle
12 gauge  - Shotguns
Darts     - Dart gun
Batteries - Electronic stun gun

Any experimental weapons that you
encounter might require their own kinds
of ammunition.

The weapons with non-lethal effect are:

- Fists
- Baton
- Dart gun
- Electronic stun gun

Some weapons (such as the dart gun) may
have a prolonged damage effect, that the
armor does not protect against. You will
notice this when the health bar starts
to decrease even if you have armor left,
and your character flashes. Using a
first aid kit stops this.


11. AGENT HINTS & TACTICS

Enemies detect you by sight and sound.
When you crouch-walk (sneak), they will
not hear you.

Enemies might be expecting you when
there has been gunfire or other loud
noises just before. It might be
beneficial to let things calm down
before proceeding.

Reloading in the middle of combat can
prove fatal. Therefore it is often wise
to ensure beforehand (use FIRE+DOWN to
reload) that you have a fresh
magazine.

A damage bonus is added to surprise
attacks from behind (for example, a
guard might go down with one blow of the
Baton).

An Agent might not necessarily have to
kill; double points are awarded for non-
lethal defeat of an enemy.

Good luck on your adventure!
